# Inflation Predictor (ML Model)

Welcome to the "Inflation Predictor (ML Model)" repository! This repository hosts the machine learning model developed to predict inflation rates based on GDP and unemployment rate data. 
The model was developed using Google Colab, a cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment, and is now available for easy access and deployment.
